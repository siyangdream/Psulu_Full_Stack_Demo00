//Global Variable (since it has to be interacted with html5, and it will be easier)
var background;
var submarine;
var finish_line;


//// STEP1 : INITIALIZATION ---

//this game will have only 1 state
var GameState = {
  
  //load the game assets before the game starts
  preload: function() {
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/images/water_background.jpg');
    this.load.image('submarine', 'assets/images/submarine.png');
    this.load.image('finish_line', 'assets/images/finish_line.png');
  },
  
  //executed after everything is loaded
  create: function() {
    background = this.game.add.sprite(0, 0, 'background'); // two roles here : one is to add sprite, the other one is to assign reference
      
    submarine = this.game.add.sprite(100, 1000, 'submarine');
    submarine.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);
    submarine.scale.setTo(-0.1, 0.1);
    
    finish_line = this.game.add.sprite(1000, 100, 'finish_line');
    finish_line.anchor.setTo(0.5, 0.5);
    finish_line.scale.setTo(0.3, 0.3);
  
  },
  
  //this is executed multiple times per second
  update: function() {
  },
  
};


//// STEP2 : INTERACTION ---

//Interaction with Front-End User


//initiate the Phaser framework
var game = new Phaser.Game(1100, 1100, Phaser.AUTO);

game.state.add('GameState', GameState);
game.state.start('GameState');
